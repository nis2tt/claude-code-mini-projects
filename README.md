Welcome to the Claude Code Crash Course! This repository is designed to teach you the fundamentals and advanced concepts of Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for AI-powered software development, in a hands-on way.

## What is Claude Code? 💡

Claude Code is an interactive command-line interface that brings Claude's AI capabilities directly to your development workflow. It helps with code analysis, bug fixing, feature development, refactoring, and workflow automation - all from your terminal.

## How it Works 🤔

This repository uses a unique branch-based structure for learning:

1.  **Each `project/*` branch covers a specific Claude Code feature or concept.**
2.  **Within each branch, commits are ordered chronologically.** Follow the commits one by one to learn the topic step-by-step.

Simply check out the branch for the topic you want to learn and walk through the commits!

## Available Topics (Branches) 📚

Here are the topics currently available:

| Branch | Topic | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `project/custom-commands` | 🔧 Custom Commands | Learn to extend Claude Code with custom functionality like dad joke generators and automated commits |
| `project/mcp` | 🔗 MCP Integration | Master Model Context Protocol integration with Context7 MCP server |
| `project/context-engineering-mcp` | ⚡ Fine-Grained MCP Configuration | Optimize context tokens with task-specific MCP configurations using `--mcp-config` flag |
| `project/subagents` | 🤖 Subagents | Build specialized AI agents within Claude Code like Code Comedy Carl |
